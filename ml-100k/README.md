# Instructions to run the code

## Prerequisites
First, make sure you have Python installed. The code is complied in Jupyter notebooks: `assignment1.ipynb` for Assigment 1, `assignment2.ipynb` for Assignment 2, `assignment3.ipynb` for Assignment 3, or `assignment4.ipynb` for Assignment 4. To run the code, you need to install the following packages:
- `notebook`
```
pip install notebook
```
- `pandas`
```
pip install pandas
```
- `numpy`
```
pip install numpy
```

## Using the Jupyter notebook
To open the notebook, you can use the following command:
```
jupyter notebook Script.ipynb
```
